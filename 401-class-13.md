## Review, Research, and Discussion

* What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
* Does socket.io use HTTP? Why? yes, because it will attach on Http server  so it can serve its own client code ports (80,)
* What happens when a client emits an event? if the server have a listener on that event it will provoke it and send the event emitted payload to the listener to use it.
* What happens when a server emits an event? client will listen to that event and act accordingly.
* What happens if a client “misses” an event? the client sends a disconnect event and then reattempts the connection with a connect event.  
* How can we mitigate this?

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Socket: A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines
* Web Socket: a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
* Socket.io:  is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
* Client :  desktop computer or workstation that is capable of obtaining information and applications from a server.
* Server : is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".
* OSI Model : (Open Systems Interconnection model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology
* TCP Model: is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model.
* TCP : Transmission Control Protocol - is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets.
* UDP : (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet
* Packets:  network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

# Readings: React Native

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
   * toolkit has a bitter way in writing reducers
   * slices allow us to directly define the actions
   * ducks is easier to read as its more details
   * wiring in slicers are more confusing the ducks

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
   * baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* redux toolkit slices: A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name".

* namespace:  refers to the programming paradigm of providing scope to the identifiers (names of types, functions, variables, etc) to prevent collisions between them.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. react-Native.
   2. Native component.
   3. JSX.

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. react native app .
2. useful libraries for apps UI/UX   .
3.is it recommended to build games with native ? .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? how to use our react knowledge in native and how similar the are to each other.
***

* `<ScrollViews>` can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the `pagingEnabled` props.
* Swiping horizontally between views can also be implemented on Android using the `ViewPager` component.
* On iOS a ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the maximumZoomScale and minimumZoomScale props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.
* `onPress` prop is equal to `onClick` one on react

# Reading: Props and State

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Does a deployed React application require a server?
  * You don't necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app
* Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  * because you want to test the whole page behavior as that what would the user see and deal with its better to test the whole app behavior.
* What does npm run build do?
  * npm run build: runs the build field from the package.json scripts field

* Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application?
  * components of the page created separately with there own style file, methods , classes/hooks if they are needed.
  * there is an `App` which is the container of the components and the general styling is in it.
  * the index renders out the `App` file on the browser

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. BDD : Behavior-Driven Development is a Test-First, Agile Testing practice that provides Built-In Quality by defining (and potentially automating) tests before, or as part of, specifying system behavior.
2. Acceptance Tests: An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.
3. mounting :  is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM).
4. build : npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Inside the build/static directory will be your JavaScript and CSS files. Each filename inside of build/static will contain a unique hash of the file contents. This hash in the file name enables long term caching techniques.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. BDD.
   2. components props  .
   3. setState .

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. props usage.
2. testing .
3. mounting methods .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? testing an react app and how to do the BDD.

# Read: Stacks & Queues

## Stacks

* A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each Node references the `next` Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
* Stacks follow these concepts:
  * FILO: This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
  * LIFO : Last In First Out
* stack methods: 
  * push
  * pop
  * peek
  * isEmpty

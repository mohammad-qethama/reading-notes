# Hashtables (Class)

## Definitions

1. hash :  is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.
2. Hashtable : uses the hashing to save the value in the array index that equals to its hash which is generated using the values key.

3. hash map process to store a value:
   1. accept a key
   2. calculate the hash of the key
   3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index

4. Hash maps do this to read value:
   1. accept a key
   2. calculate the hash of the key
   3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
   4. use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
   5. search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

5. It’s possible to compute the “load factor” of a hash table. The load factor tells us something about how full the hash table is. A hash table can start with only a few buckets, calculate it’s own load factor, recognize when it gets too full and automatically grow and add more buckets to itself to accommodate more data.(not in the scoop og the class )

## Internal Methods

1. `Add()`

   * When adding a new key/value pair to a hashtable:

     * send the key to the `GetHash(key)` method.
     * Once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go to that index
     * Check if something exists at that index already, if it doesn’t, add it with the key/value pair.
     * If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure `linkedList`within that bucket.

2. `Find()`

   * The Find takes in a key, gets the Hash, and goes to the index location specified. Once at the index location is found in the array, it is then   the responsibility of the algorithm the iterate through the bucket and see if the key exists and return the value.

3. `Contains()`

   * The Contains method will accept a key, and return a bool on if that key exists inside the hashtable.
   * The best way to do this is to have the contains call the `GetHash()` and check the hashtable if the key exists in the table given the index returned.

4. `GetHash()`

   * The GetHash will accept a key as a string, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.

***

```Pseudo
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16.

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
    * PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource.
    * PUT request overwrites everything
    * Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.
    * you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won’t affect or change anything else.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
   * [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
   * [mockable.io](https://www.mockable.io/)
   * [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
   * Popularity: By comparing stats,  swagger-ui is more popular then apidocjs.
   * Consistency: If we already using swagger for our Dotnetcore service, then implementing swagger tool will consist more from Info and UI prospective.
   * apidocjs and swagger both required documentation content on implemented method as customize comment data
   * Maintenance: For apidocjs will have to modify documentation for each affected method/endpoints if service changed. In swagger we can limit changes. But by implementing apidocjs we can isolate the layer.
   * Future: Due to popularity of swagger, apidocjs provide information about apidoc-swagger converter so we can switch apidoc to swagger anytime.

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

    * SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
    * SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.
    * SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications while REST uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device.
    * SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn’t need much bandwidth.
    * SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.
    * SOAP cannot make use of REST whereas REST can make use of SOAP.

# Readings: Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does a component’s lifecycle refer to? its the cycle of creating using and  deleting the component .
2. Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect? useCallback will help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders.
3. Why are functional components preferred over class components? because the `this` in JS is difrrent than other OOP languages, and classe  can make the code complex m and there is a higher chance of code redundancy when using classes .  
4. What is wrong with the following code?

```JS
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```

* you cant use for loop outside the useEffect it will trigger it multipletime the for loop must be inside the useEffect
* renderedItems will be undifined inside the useEffects so it must be saved in State using UseState and edited using UseElementName
* function is not exported also

> working code

```JS
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  let [renderedItems,SetrenderedItems] =  useState([]);
  
  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }
  
  
  useEffect( () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      console.log('component mount/update');
      
  SetrenderedItems([...renderedItems,<div key={i}>Item</div>]);
    }
  }, [count]);

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}


export default MyComponent;
```

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. state hook :is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

2. effect hook: is a hook that let you access `componentWillMount` `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` functionalities from the  function components

3. reducer hook:   An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. UseReduce  .
   2. Redux.
   3. custom hooks.

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. creating costume hooks.
2. useCallBack and useReduce  .
3. async hooks and how to use them with apis.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? the async hooks and how to put loading while the promise is running.

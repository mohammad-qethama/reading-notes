# Reading:  AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Describe “The Cloud”
  * servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
  * a form of operating system virtualization.
  * A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application.  
  * is a method to package an application so it can be run, with its dependencies, **isolated from other processes**.

* What is auto-scaling?
  * s a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.

* What is bandwidth??
  * scribes the maximum data transfer rate of a network or Internet connection. It measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time.

  * channel bandwidth  is  defined as the occupied bandwidth of a modulated waveform which corresponds to the frequency range containing 99% of the total power of the modulated signal.

* How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  * The three biggest cost centers related to a cloud environment include network, compute, and storage.
  
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Server Instances :  is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
* Containers : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another
* Cloud Services : is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
* Cloud Architecture :  refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems.
* AWS : amazon web services subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
* EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku : both are cloud computing services but heroku when come to auto-scaling can have a jump in prices while ec2/beanstalk is fairly linear ;thus, heroku is simpler to deploy and use while ec2 is more complex and need some knowledge to use

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. CDN.
   2. Serverless architecture .
   3. Pay per use.  
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. examples on lambda functions  .
2. CDN cashing techniques .
3. serverless backend in lambda.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? S3 database usage and how to actually use lambda function in our backend side.

# operators 

## comparison operators 
an operators used to compare between two -or more- variables , values , expressions, and it will produce a boolean as result. 

### some comparison operators: 

Operator symbol| Name | output of an example 
----------|------------------|------------
`==`|Equal to | `hello == hi ` returns `false`
`!=`|Not equal to | `hello != hi` returns `true`
`===` | Strict equal to| `3 === '3'` returns `false` 
`!==` | Strict not equal to | `3 !== '3'` returns `false` 
`>`| Greater than| `4 > 2` returns `true`
`<`| Less than | `4 < 2` returns ` false`
`>=` | Greater than or Equal | `5 >=5` returns `true`
`<=`|Less than or equal| `5 <= 6` returns `false`

# Logical operators 

operator used to process boolean values , results , variables 

##  The Logical operators
* `&&` logical and 
   * Both of the conditions are tested 
   * if both of them are true it returns true other false 
* `||` Logical or 
   * one condition is tested 
   * if one of them is true then it will returns true 
* `!` Not 
    * inverts its boolean input 
    * !true = false , !false = true 

# Loops 
 a piece of code that will run  repeatedly until a certain condition became false 
 # For loops 
 its a loop that repeat for a specific number of times (counter conditioned )
Syntax:

``` for (var i = 0  ; i > 5 : i++) ```

 * `var i = 0` 
    * assignment for an initial condition it will be executed one time. 

* ` i > 5` 
   * the condition , loops keep running as long as it returns true. 
   * `i++` 
      * update statement , changes the value of the counter i. 

## While loops 
the condtion here is pure logical one it can be counter or anything else that produce true or false. 

### Syntax 

```
 While (A != 'A'){
 doc.write(A) 
} 
```

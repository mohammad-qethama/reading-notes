# Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How granular should your reducers be? to a reasonable state where you don't have large function neither having so much files from trying to granulate the reducer, just its easy to maintain and read point.

2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
   * pro if it was intintional as it keeps the code DRY
   * con if its was not expected to fire can cause wired bugs (could happen if multi people works on the same project)

3. Name a strategy for preventing the above. using single action.js file can make it easier to debug the con part if its bug happens
.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

store
combined reducers

* store : A store is an immutable object tree in Redux and the objects setters.
* combined reducers : multiple reducers that must be combined to  single one using `combineReducers`

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? how to use the thunk functions .

## Notes and Summries

* Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects
  * "Side effects" are code that changes state/behavior outside a function, like AJAX calls, modifying function arguments, or generating random values
* Middleware add an extra step to the standard Redux data flow
  * Middleware can intercept other values passed to dispatch
  * Middleware have access to dispatch and getState, so they can dispatch more actions as part of async logic
* The Redux "Thunk" middleware lets us pass functions to dispatch
  * "Thunk" functions let us write async logic ahead of time, without knowing what Redux store is being used
  * A Redux thunk function receives dispatch and getState as arguments, and can dispatch actions like "this data was received from an API response"

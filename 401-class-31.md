# Readings: Component Composition

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app? to have multi layouts and multi functionalities separately.
2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
   * Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`
   * why ? because all the app need to be wrapped in the `<BrowserRouter />` and outside of the routes to render it on every route
3. What does props.children contain? all the children of the components tag  in the parent page.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. Composition : is a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop. 
2. Children / Child Components: is a more specific part inside a parent component.

3. Hash Routing:   using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content.
4. Link Routing :`<Router>` that uses the HTML5 history API ( pushState , replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. 

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. React hooks  .
   2. pure function .
   3. declaring state with useState.

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. creating costume hooks.
2. how can we use hooks  better than we use the classes (i think the classes where a nightmare ) .
3. the most common npm packages of hooks (costume hooks ).

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?a full single page application with only hooks.

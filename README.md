# Growth mindset in my mind 

i think a growth mindset is a way to always look for a positive side not happy side a ***positive*** one.
 
you should does not like having difficulties thats what hard wired in us but to challenge your self find a solution think logically and take a positive futuristic look of the current situation consequences is a very smart mindset that would allow you to grow ; a **growth mindset**.

# My growth mindset 

to maintain this mindset i think that i need to remind myself to : 

1. do not be too harsh on myself 
   * failure is a human nature, a way to learn 
2. set up a goal 
   * keep in my mind most of the benefits come from the journey not the arrival. 
3. seek help 
   * take criticizes and work on improving

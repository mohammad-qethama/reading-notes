# Readings: Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
   * the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes.
   * hidden (private)constructor.
   * public getInstance method that returns instance of the class

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
try to copy/push the req,res objects.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Router Middleware: a function that have access to the res and req objects.
Dynamic Module Loading:  is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory.

Singleton Pattern: is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
CRUD -> REST Method Matches: Create(post) Read(get) Update(put) Delete(delete) is a set of methods that follows the REST architecture

Mock Testing : using objects that replace real objects in our code while it's being tested

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. DataBase Hashing.
   2. HTTP Basic authentication.
   3. CAPTCHA.
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. bcrypt .
2. hashing in mongoDb with nodejs.
3. how much security is implemented in real life and who to know and update my webapp security i mean the methodology.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? Authentication in node.js implementation

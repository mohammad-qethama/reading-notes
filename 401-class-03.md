# Readings: Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
   1. authentication
   2. sorting/pagination
   3. parameters validation

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware? true
3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
   instead of next():
   1. res.end() end the responce process.
   2. res.json() send JSON response.
   3. res.render() render template .
   4. res.send() send a response and end the process;

4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?  
    * at any point of the request life cycle

5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
    * that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Middleware : Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what’s offered by the operating system.
Request Object: The Request object retrieves the values that the client browser passed to the server during an HTTP request.
Response Object The Response object, which contains a server's response to an HTTP request.
Application Middleware : Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system.
Routing Middleware:  functions to run code on each request, or on each request for a certain route, and to take action on request or response data.
Test Driven Development : refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).
Behavioral Testing : Behavioral Testing is a testing of the external behavior of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. Static methods and properties
   2. route paths based on string patterns.
   3. the usage of next() .
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   1. express.routes() usages
   2. classes real world usages
   3. the app.x method's of express real world examples
   
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? express.routes()

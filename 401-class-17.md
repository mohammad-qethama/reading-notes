# Reading:  AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* What are serverless functions?

  * functions that not implemented or maintained on the server itself.

* If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
  * i don't know actually its very complicated i cant even think how to do it.

* Describe how a CDN works ?
  * its a geographically distributed servers that had a server copy and information cashed so its can serve the users that is near it.

   1. dynamoDB.
   2. API Gateway .
   3. Amazon Cognito. 

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. lambda with API gateaway integration .
2. dynamoDb set up in server .
3. more about the inner cloud latency .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? i want to see simple or a whole server hosted on the aws i would like to see a full walk through from our laps .

# Reading: Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important? to organize data access and prevent data leaks , each person can access only the amount of resources needed for them.
2. Describe an application that would need access control. application with users and admin/creators like journal websites , blogs ones  and accounting apps or sites that have legal information or sensitive infos that only limited people should access.
3. What is a role used for? used to determine each person authorities by the role assigned to them
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control? because you only need to change the role for person to change their access abilities , also you can easily reset roles rules if its needed without changing every user that have that role

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Role Based Access Control : a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges .
* Capabilities : what one can , what is they given permission to do .


* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. event driven programming.
   2. object oriented programming 
   3. Event , listeners. 
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. event listeners proper usage  .
2. using events to change the the flow of execution between objects.
3. debugging event listner tools/techniques .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? even listener on the server side.

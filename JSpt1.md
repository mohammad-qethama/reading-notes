# Expressions 

Expression is a line of code that evaluates into single value. 
# Operators 

it can process multiple values into single one so **Expressions** rely on it.

types of operators and examples :

* Function answer you with a return value i.e its result 

 ***define a  simple function syntax is:***
 ```
 function functionname(){

    
 } 
 functionname();
```

*****

 ``***define a function that needs information syntax is:***
 ```
 function functionname(Value1,Value2, Value3){
return Value1 * Value2 % Value3
    
 } 
 functionname(123, 34,5); // Calling it

 ```

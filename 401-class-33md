# Readings: Context API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()?
   * useMemo() helps to avoid expensive calculations on every rerunder
   * useMemo() thus used to speed up our website
   * useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

2. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?  to help static analyzer to warn for errors.

3. What do custom hooks usually do? its a hook that calls another hooks and do certain functionality with them

4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications? react-redux

5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work. it will setState when we add/edit/delete data and read the state after setting it when we get it from the api

   2. useMemo.
   3. redux.

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. the proper usage of context .
2. useful custom-hooks packages  .
3. useCallBack and useMemo  as the examples in the reads are really poor .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? optimizing the code and why do i need context and who to use them .

# Reading: Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Steps correct order:
   * Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
   * Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
   * Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
   * Receive authorization code
   * Make a request to the access token endpoint
   * Receive access token
   * Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

2. What can you do with an authorization code? my application can use it to obtain an access token

3. What can you do with an access token? used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API.

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication? 
   * It allows you to read data of a user from another application. 
   * It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices. 
   * Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Client ID : is a unique and public eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients.
* Client Secret : is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable. 
* Authentication Endpoint :  is an authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of a network's external or remote connecting device.
* Access Token Endpoint : is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user.
* API Endpoint : is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.It refers to touch-points of the communication between an API and a server.
* Authorization Code: The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token.
* Access Token: contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. bearer token 
   2. jwt signature
   3. Registered claims.
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. using jwt in node.
2. mongodb and refreshing jwt.
3. security issues of jwt .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? bearer auth tokens.

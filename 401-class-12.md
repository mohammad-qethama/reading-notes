# Reading: Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? to avoid having detecating channel data traffic , (packet-switching),avoid blocking traffic (store and forward ) , utalizing the channel (statistical-multiplexing)
UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this? , a message can be sent from one end point to another without prior arrangement. (no ACK )
Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? yes.
Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?yes
Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? yes

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Observer Pattern :  is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
* Listener : is a function that is invoked when a particular event occurs, typically with an event object containing information about the event.
* Event Handler : the code of the listener/or the Listener
* Event Driven Programming : programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads.
* Event Loop :  the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.
* Event Queue : the queue thats regulate functions/data flow between api and the call stack
* Call Stack : the memory where the execution of function pushed to be executed/ a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.
* Emit/Raise/Trigger : provoking the event ,activating the listener
* Subscribe :  function is similar to the Promise.then(), .catch() and .finally() methods in jQuery, but instead of dealing with promises it deals with Observables.
* database :  is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

# Reading: Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

    What does the JSON Web Token package do?
    What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
   * basic auth used to sign in and authnticate the users by thier name and password
   * bearer auth used to  authenticate users using a token without the neediness to resign in.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

   * create token/signature `.sign()`  of a `SECRET`  and use algorthims to encrypt them and provide options to them.

   * verify tokens and retrive thier pay load headers `.verify` using the `SECRET`.



3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
   * store it in the .env file i.e never show them to public
   * use randomly generated and long secrets with proper pseudo random algorithms.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


encryption

bearer
secret
JSON Web Token

* encryption  : is the process of hidding the data and change its form 
* token : is a piece of encrypted information that used to athunticate users by sending it only .
* secret :  a piece of information that is usually long and random value known only to the authserver  used to crypt and decrypt jwt.
* JSON Web Token : type of token that uses 3 main parts of header payload and a secret then to be created as a signature by encrypted the three parts as inputs to encryption algorithm (like `HMAC`).

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. access control.
   2. MAC(mandatory access control )
   3. sessions
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. who to define rules .
2. what is the solution for RBAC flows.
3. better ways to manage data .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? RBAC in node.js and who to use it with the authentication  server.

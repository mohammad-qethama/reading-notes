# Implementation: Linked Lists

## Definitions

1. Linked List : is a list of `Nodes` that refers/linked to each other.

2. `Singly` linked list: means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the`Next` node in a linked list

3. data structures :  which are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures.

4. Big O Notation: is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm

5. the Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

## Notes on traversing through nodes

1. If we accidentally end up trying to traverse on a node that is null, a NullReferenceException gets thrown and our program will crash/end

2. The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.

```Pseudo
ALGORITHM Add(newValue)
// INPUT <-- Value to add
// OUTPUT <-- No output

  newNode <-- NEW Node
  newNode.Value <-- newValue
  newNode.Next <-- Head
  Head <-- newNode

```

> Pseudo code for adding new node at with O(1) efficiency

* A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.

* a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element

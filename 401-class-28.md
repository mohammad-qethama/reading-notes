# Readings: Component Composition

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
  * we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child's state
* What can be passed along in a prop variable?
  * variables , params , data .
* How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
  * we cant know the state of other components

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. component props : “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
2. component state :  the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component

3. application state :  is encapsulated data where you store assets that are persistent between component renderings.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. The Component Lifecycle .
   2. `componentDidMount`  method and what to use inside of it.
   3. react Hoc : A (higher-order component) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. .

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. using react HOCs in authorization.
2. better understanding on props and composition what is  the differences ?  .
3. the life cycle methods usages.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? i want to see when and why we use props and the same questions for composition.

# Readings: Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
   1. Better program design and higher code quality
   2. TDD reduces the time required for project development
   3. Save project costs in the long run

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
   * beforeEach() used to preset the tests before executing each one of them
   * afterEach() to reset some parameters and execute any thing after each test done running.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

   * Tests got to be maintained when requirements change

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    * The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

5. Why REST?
    * they provide a great deal of flexibility.
    * Using the HTTP protocol means REST is a simple request/response mechanism.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* functional programming :is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
* object-oriented programming (OOP) : is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
* class: is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
* `super` : The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
* `this` : The `this` references the object of which the function is a property. In other words, the `this` references the object that is currently calling the function
* Test Driven Development (TDD): refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).
* Jest : is a library for testing JavaScript code. It's an open source project maintained by Facebook, and it's especially well suited for React code testing, although not limited to that: it can test any JavaScript code.
* Continuous Integration (CI) : is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
* REST : Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services.
* Data Model : is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities

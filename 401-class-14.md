# Reading: Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?  A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order. In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order.
* How can the server be assured a message was properly received? by expecting to receive an event from the client that the massaged `received` by it
* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? Singleton 
* How do you test an event driven system? testing the event input , testing the event listeners functions.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* FIFO Queue : is a method for organising the manipulation of a data structure where the oldest entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.
* Pub/Sub : is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. AWS.
   2. lambda .
   3. decoupling .
* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. sqs usage  .
2. pulling from queue algorithm .
3. using aws  .

# Reading:  AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

  * both uses RESTful api and uses HTTP for res/req , both uses function to handle those requests and create proper response.

* List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
  * Amazon DynamoDB : noSQL\fast\
  * Amazon Aurora : Traditional applications, ERP, CRM, e-commerce/MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible/
  * Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached:Managed, Memcached-compatible, in-memory store. Sub-millisecond latency to power real-time applications./low capcity / on memory (RAM) DB
  * Amazon Neptune: A scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service
  * Amazon DocumentDB : computable with mongoDB // Durable, available, and secure / manged by aws.
  * Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) : Cryptographically Verifiable/Highly Available.

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
  * Fifo is more strict in the First in first out role  while standard queue can break it occasionally.

* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
  * by listening to a received event  triggered when the message received , also it can use signatures to check the message , can use CRC or Sum-check(XOR) on the message / message headers  .  

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. Serverless API  : API gateway that handles request  and response without integrating it in the server .


2. Triggers:   resource or a resource in another service that you configure to invoke your function in response to lifecycle events, external requests, or on a schedule.

3. DynamoDB vs Mongo:

   * DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.
   * MongoDB is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS.
   * DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions.
   * DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
   * DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

4. Dynamoose vs Mongoose
   * Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by Mongoose)
   * Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

* Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

   1. SQS VS SNS now i can see clear difference in purpose, mechanism and functionality  .
   2. amazon kinesis streams vs Queueu .
   3. cloudwatch usage .

* Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

1. SQS and SNS in node js .
2. more about queues .
3. sns retries and alarm features configures .

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?  SQS and SNS usage with our apps and how to utilize it  .

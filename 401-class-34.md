1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”?

2. Explain 3rd party cookies: cookies that save in the browser via 3rd party sites like google and trackers that we uses there services in our website but not directly by us.

3. How do pixel tags work? The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.

   ```HTML

    <img style="“display: none”;" src="“Tracking">

   ```

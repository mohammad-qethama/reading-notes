 ex:
     
     for i in lis1  
        print(lis1[x])
        x = x+1 
    print ('resault'+x)

```
First Header | Second Header
-------------| -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
 Content in the first column | Content in the second coloumn 
```
**and there is the output with extra column :**

First Header | Second Header| extra hidder
